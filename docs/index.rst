Dynophores are an intuitive tool to explore the dynamics of molecular interactions between a 
macromolecule and a ligand throughout an MD simulation. 

A **dynophore** is a collection of so-called **superfeatures**. 
A superfeature is defined as a pharmacophore feature on ligand site 
(defined by a feature type, e.g. HBA, and one or more ligand atom numbers/serials) that occurs 
at least once during an MD simulation. A superfeature can have one or more interaction partner(s) 
on macromolecule-side. 
These interaction partners are called **environmental partners**. 
Superfeatures and their environmental partners are monitored throughout an MD simulation.

This Python library offers visualization schemes for dynophore data generated with the 
``DynophoreApp`` in a single Jupyter Notebook 
(`template dynophore notebook <https://dynophores.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/dynophore.html>`_).  

- 3D view of the dynophore's point clouds (one cloud per superfeature) using ``nglview`` allows easy visual inspection of the dynamic macromolecule-ligand interactions. Point clouds are rendered alongside the topology and (optionally) the trajectory underlying the dynophore. See details in `this tutorial on 3D views <https://dynophores.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/explore_view3d.html>`_.
- Statistics cover the occurrence of superfeatures and their environmental partners as well as distances between them. See details in `this tutorial on plotting options <https://dynophores.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/explore_plots.html>`_.
- Dynophore data can be further analyzed conveniently right there in the same notebook by working with the ``Dynophore`` class. See details in `this tutorial on the dynophore data structure <https://dynophores.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/explore_data.html>`_.
