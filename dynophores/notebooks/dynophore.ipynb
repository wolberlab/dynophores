    "\n",
    "* A **dynophore** is a collection of so-called superfeatures. \n",
    "* A **superfeature** is defined as a pharmacophore feature on the ligand side &mdash; defined by a feature type and one or more ligand atoms &mdash; that occurs at least once during an MD simulation. Example: HBA[4618] (feature type, ligand atom numbers)\n",
    "* A superfeature has a **point cloud**, where each point corresponds to the centroid of feature during one frame of the trajectory.\n",
    "* A superfeature can have one or more interaction partner(s) on the macromolecule side. These interaction partners are called **environmental partners**. Example: GLN-131-A[2057] (residue name, residue number, chain, atom serial numbers)."

    "* **Dynophore raw data** can be analyzed conveniently right here in this notebook by working with the `Dynophore` class.\n",
    "* **Dynophore 2D view** shows all superfeatures on a 2D view of the structure-bound ligand using `rdkit`.\n",
    "* **Dynophore 3D view** maps each superfeature's point cloud in 3D using `nglview`, allowing for an easy visual inspection of the dynamic macromolecule-ligand interactions. Point clouds are rendered alongside the complex structure's topology and (optionally) the trajectory underlying the dynophore.\n",
    "* **Dynophore statistics** cover the occurrence of superfeatures and their environmental partners as well as distances between them."
